#### _Full Stack Web App project, Ironhack Web Development - Module 2, 2021_

## Introduction

Journo is a Full Stack Web App project, developed on the sixth week of the Web Development bootcamp at  [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en). 

An app built for two types of users: writers or editors. Either profile has access to a News API, that allow the users to search for any relevant article of their interest, and save them. As a writer, you have the ability to write your own articles, manage them, and publish them.
As an editor, you can look through all the published articles, save them, like them and even request to publish them on your magazine/ newspaper.

Journo uses Node.js with Express.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, Handlebars and CSS.
